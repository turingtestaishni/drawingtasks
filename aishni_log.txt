1. Setting up.
1.1 `git submodule update --init --recursive` failed for `block_utils` because the repository does not exist ('404 not found')
1.2 installation (avoiding anaconda); 
1.2.1 installed python3.7.7 from here https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/
1.2.2 created a virtualenv with python3.7 -m venv drawingtasks
1.2.3 You are using pip version 19.2.3, however version 22.3.1 is available.You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip
1.2.4 pip install -r requirements.txt
1.2.4.1 
pregrex requires python 3.9 pregex==0.3.2 removed this line
1.2.4.2 
The conflict is caused by: The user requested urllib3==1.26.6; botocore 1.20.103 depends on urllib3<1.27 and >=1.25.4 requests 2.22.0 depends on urllib3!=1.25.0, !=1.25.1, <1.26 and >=1.21.1; so i will change version to urllib3==1.25.11
1.2.4.3 
there is a problem with pycairo

  note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.
  ERROR: Failed building wheel for pycairo

so i looked up online here: https://github.com/googlefonts/gftools/issues/121 alexeiva commented https://github.com/pygobject/pycairo/issues/39#issuecomment-454689537 which installed brew, export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH, then brew install pkg-config, brew install cairoi, pip3 -r install requirements.txt now passes previous error; successfully installed all requirements
1.2.5 set up step 3 Install the NLTK word tokenize package. python -m nltk.downloader 'punkt';
1.2.5.1 
there was an error; [nltk_data] Error loading punkt: <urlopen error [SSL:
[nltk_data]     CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed:
[nltk_data]     unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1076)>
False;
I fixed it using import nltk
import ssl

try:
    _create_unverified_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context
except AttributeError:
    pass
else:
    ssl._create_default_https_context = _create_unverified_https_context

nltk.download(); this opened a window where I selected models > punkt > download; this worked; but it has stored it in aishni/ i am tempted to move this inside the project folder and set a path, will deal with this later ****;

2. Quickstart: generating the CogSci 2022 dataset.
2.1 
I checked dir data/renders, data/libraires, data/summaries and ls *.csv: all seem to contain data already; perhaps I don't need to regenerate?
2.1.1 
for sanity check i could temporarily remove these files and see if I am able to regenerate them
2.1.2
Run each of the following lines to generate tasks from 4 domains: nuts_bolts, dials, wheels and furnitures.
python generate_drawing_tasks.py --tasks_generator nuts_bolts_programs --num_tasks_per_condition all --train_ratio 0.8 --task_summaries;

python generate_drawing_tasks.py --tasks_generator dials_programs --num_tasks_per_condition all --train_ratio 0.8 --task_summaries;

python generate_drawing_tasks.py --tasks_generator wheels_programs --num_tasks_per_condition all --train_ratio 0.8 --task_summaries;

python generate_drawing_tasks.py --tasks_generator furniture_programs --num_tasks_per_condition all --train_ratio 0.8 --task_summaries;

So when I define my new domain, I would have to do something similar;

2.2 Inspect generate_drawing_tasks.py
2.2.1
Generate tasks and their corresponding programs
There are 4 domains: nuts_bolts, dials, wheels and furnitures, and three hand-coded ones (I think they are s12_s13, s14_s15, and s16_s17)
This file just reads cmd line args and calls respective functions in tasksgenerator/
2.2.2 task_generator.py has one public function called random_sample_ratio_ordered_array, and three classes namely, TaskCurriculum, AbstractTasksGenerator, ManualCurriculumTasksGenerator(AbstractTasksGenerator), and DrawingTask(Task). The first thing that happens is generate_drawing_tasks makes a TasksGeneratorRegistry which uses a pypi package class-registry to manage.
Then it passes this registry objec to generate_tasks_curriculum in AbstractTasksGenerator class.
I am creating a new branch to print the outputs called "test_tasks_generator"
2.2.3 git status showed dreamcoder had new commits and modified content, so i did git submodule update --recursive dreamcoder
Submodule path 'dreamcoder': checked out 'aec40a9a224785aac899afbfc4399ff52c3cfdfe'.
2.2.4 
This is a good resource for branch and merging
git checkout -b test_tasks_generator 
Switched to a new branch 'test_tasks_generator'
I will delete things in data/renders, data/libraires, data/summaries, removed *.csv and *.json
git add data/ aishni_log.txt 
used git push --set-upstream origin test_tasks_generator
2.2.5
added print stmt
ran python generate_drawing_tasks.py --tasks_generator furniture_programs --num_tasks_per_condition all --train_ratio 0.8 --task_summaries

before trying to debug dreamcoder, checked in with author about implementing on ubuntu vs mac
